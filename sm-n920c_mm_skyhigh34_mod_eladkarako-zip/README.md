based on BETA-SuperSU-v2.72-20160510112018
the superSU zip has been modified <em>BY ME</em> in a very gentle way,
playing the "SYSTEMLESS=false" game, but without actually placing .supersu file under /system /data /cache
since I am not rooted yet...

this is a root+kernel package,
it will root your device with SuperSU 2.72b (in SYSTEM-MODE a.k.a "not SYSTEMLESS"),
and will apply the *latest* SkyHigh for Samsung Note 5 SM-N920C Android Marshmallow 6.0.1,
for the *new April version*.

it will probably work for similar devices too.
the <em>whole stuff is re-signed and re-aligned</em> (both SuperSU and Kernel0, so it will probably even work with classic, native recovery.. although I recommend to use <code>twrp</code>..

to figure what my modifications were,
you can put the original files side-by-side with something like <code>Beyond Compare 3</code>
..and see the differences..

you can freely distribute this package,
as long you keep credit of the original creators (for the kernel and SuperSU),
you can omit my credit, I've just packed/patched/signed it all... ;)

Enjoy.

Here is intro-screen.
