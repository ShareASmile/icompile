<blockquote>When you're developing a Chrome App with no frame at all like the one below, wouldn't that be great to have an easy way to get some default "close" and "maximize" buttons out of the box?

Thanks to a new chrome://flags/#enable-app-window-controls flag in the last chromium build, it can be done by simply inserting <window-controls></window-controls> to your html code.
