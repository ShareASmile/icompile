GoDaddy website login, now (well.. a week ago the update was pushed to production) requires a full JavaScript support, so if you've disabled JavaScript for the portal, you'll have to re-enable it, in-order to use the website as-is..
The GoDaddy admin-login page, used to relay on HTML login, but now it is 100% JavaScript-rendering ("login-ticket").
