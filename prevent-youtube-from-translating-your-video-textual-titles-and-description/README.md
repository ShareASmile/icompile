When users browse your YouTube channel, they not always get to see the original title and description you've set to the videos.

I've recently uploaded a video, 
it was English speaking and I've added my own subtitles both in Hebrew and in English.

I've gave the video a title that contained both English then a '/' character and then the Hebrew translation (in-line).
For me it made sense.

Another users notify me that my titles were having typos, which was weird, so they've sent me a screenshot of their screens.
It appears that YouTube choose to translate the English part of the title to Hebrew as well. Badly (it had typos from the auto-translation).

<hr/>

I've also noticed my channel-name (which is my own name), was translated into Hebrew. Badly.

I was not aware of any of that since my browser's language/location is defined as English(GB). 

<hr/>

As for the videos, 
you need to go back to the YouTube manager with either: https://www.youtube.com/my_videos
or the new link: https://studio.youtube.com/

hover the mouse over a video, and click the pen icon for details, 
switch from the "basic" tab to "more options". scroll down until you'll see 'to manage other languages, go to subtitles' and and click 'subtitles' link.

In my specific videos I had two lines, one for English (I've deleted the auto-translation in-favor of an accurate subtitles I've wrote), 
and one for Hebrew (which in, too, I've uploaded subtitles).

But subtitles are not 'the thing' to do here, the column 'title and description' is.

hover above Hebrew and click 'add', 
tripple click and right-click copy (in Chrome) or select everything from the start and copy (other browsers) in the title area on your left (the original/English part), 
now paste it 'as-is' into the Hebrew part on your right. This will force YouTube to use your translation, whatever it is.

do the same for the description.

No more auto-translate for the video content.

click the publish button for the title/description translation, and the back arrow on top-left to go back to the video-manager.

I has wondering about a playlist's title and description, surely there isn't need for YouTube to translate those too? Well there is.
Click the playlists button on the youtube-studio (video-manager) or browse https://www.youtube.com/view_all_playlists?nv=1 .
click the 'edit' button of the playlist you want to force not translating into Hebrew (for example).
Click the three-horizontal points and choose 'playlist settings', 
click 'advanced settings'.
the url is something like
https#x003A;//www.youtube.com/playlist?list={your playlist id}&advanced_settings=1&disable_polymer=1
close the settings-dialog, leaving you in the playlist page.
see the three-dots on the top-right?
click them.
choose 'translate playlist info'.

again similar look and feel, on the left there is the original content in what ever language it is, 
on the right you open the drop-down selection choose 'add new language', then 'Hebrew', 
and copy paste your data from the left to the right, overriding the YouTube auto-translation feature.
click 'save'.

you're done here.

<hr/>

Users may define another language to their browser, 
which may change the English part of your video/playlist video-titles.
If you care about those languages, you'll have to add those languages specifically and explicitly copy/paste your original title and description as 'your own translation' as explained above.

Bonus round.

Channel title/description.

click on your logo on the top right (if you language is in left-to-right, such as English otherwise on the left).
click the 'your channel' button.
you'll get into 
https#x003A;//www.youtube.com/channel/{your channel id}?view_as=subscriber

click customise channel.
https#x003A;//www.youtube.com/channel/{your channel id}?disable_polymer=true

click the gear icon on your right, 
scroll untill you get into the 'translate info', 
click the 'translate channel info' link.
https#x003A;//www.youtube.com/user/{your youtube user name}/translate?disable_polymer=1

again, 
add language (Hebrew) on the right, 
then copy your English content from the left, pasting it into the right title and description areas.
click save, and you'll override YouTube's auto-translation of your channel-information.

you're done.
