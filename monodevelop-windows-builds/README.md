Go to <a href="https://download.mono-project.com/archive/?C=M;O=D">https://download.mono-project.com/archive/?C=M;O=D</a>, 
you can download the latest x86 or x64 MSI (Windows Installer).

There are stable, alpha, beta and nightly.

And those without build name such as <code>mono-latest-x64-.msi</code>, which seems to be the oldest.

You can also browse throught the versions, for example: 
<a href="https://download.mono-project.com/archive/6.10.0/windows-installer/?C=M;O=D">https://download.mono-project.com/archive/6.10.0/windows-installer/?C=M;O=D</a>. 

I've noticed that GTKsharp are always x86 (32bit), 
and the x64bit do not have GTKsharp in the file-name, 
but seems to be 30MB larger than the x64 files.

You can extract MSI packages, creating an open (installable) folder.
