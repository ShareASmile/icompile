<strong>This little knot</strong> helped to save my lenovo from meeting the floor in numerous times before, 

this is the story of the most recent event: ;)
- 4am,
- big wool socks, 
- below zero temperature outside, 
- all night coding (as usual, who needs to sleep.. ;) ),
- on the way to the 14th cup'o-coffee... tripping the wire (again..),
