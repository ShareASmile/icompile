This version is pretty much the latest one you'll see online: https://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.21.1/

But the real latest one (to date) binary (ready to use!) is this one:
https://www.busybox.net/downloads/binaries/1.26.2-defconfig-multiarch/

Few notes:
<ol>
  <li>
    Binary - meaning- there is no installation app.
    You'll need to place it under <code>/xbin</code>,
    on your device, and you'll probably need root access to do this.
  </li>
  <li>
    Make it executable using <code>chmod u+x full_path_to_your_file_name</code>, or <code>chmod 0755 full_path_to_your_file_name</code>
    Don't forget to run <code>/system/xbin/busybox --install -s /system/xbin</code> for 100% making sure all the busybox applets works fine..  :]
  </li>
  <li>
    If you don't know/ don't want to do [1+2], just download and run the (free) <img src="https://icompile.eladkarako.com/_uploads/2017/07/budybox_app.png" alt="busybox installer" title="busybox installer" width="48" height="48"/> busybox installer from the store (for Android devices).
  </li>
  <li>
    There are few options,
    of which busybox file to download and use.

    First of all- version.
    You better use the latest one (to date) which is version 2.26.2,
    it includes many bug-fixes and improvements since version 2.20/2.21,
    and even adds new features for the internal-commands (of course).
    It should work just fine for you, the minimum requirements are 
    a Linux kernel with version of 2.4 or newer,
    which is supported by even the oldest Android devices.

    Secondly,
    you probably saw few variations regarding the architecture,
    <strong>The rule-of-thumb is -</strong> use <code>busybox-armv4tl</code> which is the most generic for your phone,
    and <code>busybox-i686</code> for both <code>x86</code> and <code>x64</code> devices, <a href="https://busybox.net/FAQ.html" target="_blank">as advised on the official website</a>.

    You might get better support for some features by using a more specific versions such as <code>busybox-armv4l</code> or <code>busybox-armv5l</code> - both would probably just as well,
    <code>busybox-armv6l</code> which is somewhat for the newer devices,

    <code>busybox-i686</code> is mostly compatible with Linux systems (PCs) running both x86 and x64 CPUs (you can also probably run in on Lenovo tablets too)

    <em><code>busybox-mips</code>, <code>busybox-mipsel</code>, <code>busybox-powerpc</code> and <code>busybox-sparc</code> are <strong>not for you!</strong>

    And finally, <code>busybox-x86_64</code> which is only for PCs running x64bit Intel-compatible CPU (might work *with lags* on Lenovo tablets too, but mostly for PCs only).
  </li>
  <li>
    Finally, once you've followed the instructions above,
    you probably want to rename the binary to just <code>busybox</code>,
    omitting any additional information, since most (other) 3<sup>rd</sup>-party
    apps will look for the name <code>"busybox"</code>.
    alternately (advanced method) using symbolic-link in <code>/xbin</code>, to another folder having the actual binaries <sub><em>(but don't do it. Really!)</em></sub>.
  </li>
</ol>

when running the busybox binary,
you'll see something similar to this:

Ps.
You might also want to download <code>ssl_helper-x86_64</code>,
and to place it in the same folder as the busybox binary (renaming it to <code>ssl_helper</code>).
It adds a workaround for SSL-certificate verification when using busybox's <code>wget</code>,
Not 100% sure if it is needed on Android devices too,
but it comes as a replacement for installing GNU's <code>openssl</code> and <code>ca-certificates</code>,
allowing to use certificate-verification with <code>wget</code>.
<em><sub>BUT you can (probably) always use <code>wget</code> without the verifying the certificate... :]</sub></em>
