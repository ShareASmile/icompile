<img src="https://icompile.eladkarako.com/_uploads/2017/05/icon.gif" alt="" width="64" height="64"/> Yet another useful Chrome-extension,

it workarounds the limitation of Chrome,
forbidding setting the WebSocket object to undefined by running the code,
from within the web-page, and not by proxy from the extension.
It does so by obfuscating (just a little bit) the code, running it as BASE64.

you can download it, pack it using chrome's extension page (developers mode),
and drag-and-drop the crx on to the extensions page to install it.
