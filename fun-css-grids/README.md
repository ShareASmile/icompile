two very nice and very slick products to be included in your next front-end projects (using bower! naturally) are 960.gs which uses a set numbers for columns and unsemantic.com which is based on percentages.

Essence
The 960 Grid System is an effort to streamline web development workflow by providing commonly used dimensions, based on a width of 960 pixels. There are two variants: 12 and 16 columns, which can be used separately or in tandem.

Dimensions
The 12-column grid is divided into portions that are 60 pixels wide. The 16-column grid consists of 40 pixel increments. Each column has 10 pixels of margin on the left and right, which create 20 pixel wide gutters between columns. View demo.

Purpose
The premise of the system is ideally suited to rapid prototyping, but it would work equally well when integrated into a production environment. There are printable sketch sheets, design layouts, and a CSS file that have identical measurements.

Successor to 960.gs
Unsemantic is a fluid grid system that is the successor to the 960 Grid System. It works in a similar way, but instead of being a set number of columns, it's entirely based on percentages.

For instance, if you want a 50% wide column, simply use class="grid-50". There are grid classes for multiples of five: 5, 10, 15 â€¦ 95, 100. There are also grid classes for dividing a page into thirds: grid-33 and grid-66.

SE-Oh?
By using push-x and pull-x classes, you can rearrange the visual layout of page, without affecting its source order. While SEO is a bit of a "moving target," this has been known to help search engines determine the most relevant content on a page.

Typically, code at the top of a page is what search engines tend to focus on the most, and Unsemantic can help to ensure your source code is geared towards that goal.
