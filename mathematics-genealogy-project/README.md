The Mathematics Genealogy Project is a web-based database  for the academic genealogy of mathematicians. As of 2007, it contained information on the graduation date, alma mater, doctoral advisor, and doctoral students of more than 100,000 pure and applied mathematicians, and PhD holders in related subjects.

Origins of the database
The project grew out of founder Harry Coonce's desire to know the name of his advisor's advisor. Coonce was Professor of Mathematics at Minnesota State University, Mankato, at the time of the project's founding, and the project went online there in the fall of 1997. Coonce retired from Mankato in 1999, and in the fall of 2002 the university decided that it would no longer support the project. The project relocated at that time to North Dakota State University. Since 2003, the project has also operated under the auspices of the American Mathematical Society, and in 2005 it received a grant from the Clay Mathematics Institute.

Source of information
The genealogy information is obtained from sources such as Dissertation Abstracts International and Notices of the American Mathematical Society, but may be supplied by anyone via the project's website. The searchable database contains the name of the mathematician, university which awarded the degree, year when the degree was awarded, title of the dissertation, names of the advisor and co-advisor, a flag of the country where the degree was awarded, a listing of doctoral students, and a count of academic descendants.
