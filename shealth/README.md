and created a bloatware script to remove some non-needed programs.

SHealth and its Health-service are of no use to me,  
but they have potential for anyone wish to track the amount of steps taken each day,  
track weight, and other health-related things.  

I've recently deodexed my firmware,  
making the apps easier to distribute,  
so I've archived them and put them in:  
https://github.com/eladkarako/icompile/releases/download/latest/SHealth35_and_HealthService_from_i9500_android501__put_under__system_priv-app__deodexed.7z  

If you wish to install them,  
on a rooted device,  
you put them in under /system/priv-app/  
optionally clear the cache and dalvik cache and reboot the system.
