Update: Working! You are welcome to try it yourself,
in your Chrome/Chromium browser: <code>--enable-rgba-4444-textures</code>.

<hr/>

<blockquote>
If you're having <code>N7v2</code> or <code>N10</code> it will still break..
so by default it is set to disable flag on new Chrome/Chromium versions...

If you so choose to enable it,
You'll see a ren. message (From <code>N10</code>)

I/chromium( 2104): [INFO:CONSOLE(0)] "[.WebGLRenderingContext]RENDER WARNING: texture bound to texture unit 0 is not renderable. It maybe non-power-of-2 and have incompatible texture filtering or is not 'texture complete'", source: file:///sdcard/clanktemp/index.html (0)
</pre>

I like the helpful logs,
those whom are addressing you are a thinking person,
and suggest *things* :]
