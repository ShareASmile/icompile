<em>Yaws is a HTTP high perfomance 1.1 webserver particularly well suited for dynamic-content web applications. Two separate modes of operations are supported:

Standalone mode where Yaws runs as a regular webserver daemon. This is the default mode.

Embedded mode where Yaws runs as an embedded webserver in another Erlang application.

Yaws is entirely written in Erlang, and furthermore it is a multithreaded webserver where one Erlang lightweight process is used to handle each client.

The main advantages of Yaws compared to other Web technologies are performance and elegance. The performance comes from the underlying Erlang system and its ability to handle concurrent processes in an efficent way. Its elegance comes from Erlang as well. Web applications don't have to be written in ugly ad hoc languages.</em></blockquote>

Erlang is a programming language used to build massively scalable soft real-time systems with requirements on high availability. Some of its uses are in telecoms, banking, e-commerce, computer telephony and instant messaging. Erlang's runtime system has built-in support for concurrency, distribution and fault tolerance.

<strong>What is OTP?
</strong>OTP is set of Erlang libraries and design principles providing middle-ware to develop these systems. It includes its own distributed database, applications to interface towards other languages, debugging and release handling tools.</em></blockquote>
