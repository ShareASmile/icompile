<code>Native Client</code> is a not-so-little parsing engine for "native code",
meaning not <em>JavaScript</em> but more closely to <em>C++</em>.

Go to <code>chrome://plugins/</code> and disable the <code>Native Client</code>.
Making your browser safer (reduce functionality) and faster (no need to boot-load the engine).
