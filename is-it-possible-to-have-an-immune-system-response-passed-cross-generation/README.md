A deadly fungus is attacking frogs’ skin and wiping out hundreds of species worldwide. Can anyone help California's remaining mountain yellow-legged frogs? In a last-ditch effort, scientists are trying something new: build defenses against the fungus through a kind of frog vaccine.

This video discussed with a successful cure to an infection of a population of frogs,
The question the kept coming up was how long does the an outside factor (caregiver) should be administered a cure given that a single ration would cure a single generation of frogs (but not their siblings, unless those too will be given the cure..)

<strong>In short:</strong>

Immune system does not get registered across generations,
it only takes effect for the individual, but a cure can be delivered in mass quantities to apply multiple individuals in one go, over a long period of time, across several generations, to eventually (hopefully) eradicate a repeating infection &#x1f489;. 


<strong>Why?</strong>

Genetic engineering of the packed genes (Chromosomes) in the individual's reproductive cells <em>(for example, a sperm cell or an egg)</em> is the most common way of passing information to the next generation, but is considered risky the very least ☣. 

<strong>Aren't Any Exceptions?</strong>

The only natural way of a treatment to an individual to pass along to the next generation happens in some kind of mono-cell bacterias, which may develop immunity by mutation, 
and exchange a splice of their genetic material <em>(yep!)</em> with another member of the same bacteria family, when the mono-cell, <em>now with new genetic code</em> replicate- the immunity, is, too, replicated to next generation. 

<em>(In multi-cell organisms- such as frogs, the genetic-exchange process is replaced with exchanging whole cells, namely '&#x1f438; on &#x1f438; action' ;)
Cells protects the genetic material against mutations, so in a sense passing a genetic attribute such as immune-system response-  will never happen,
instead, we are putting our faith in natural selection.. )</em>

This way, a mutation in the bacteria (which is considered a rare occasion) <em>can</em> be indirectly responsible to a spread of an immunity (or any genetic variation in that matter) to a large number of individuals, quite fast. 

*Also, This is why antibiotics shouldn't be taken excessively or stopped being administered too soon.. &#x1f44d;
