finding a loophole by working a few, pretty basic, reversed logics.. 
.. and getting around the <em>no "âˆž wishes" wish</em> rule:

<li>an unlimited amount of wishes <em>(you might as well try anyway..)</em></li>
<li>Revocation of rules prohibiting unlimited wishes</li>
<li>A finite but arbitrarily large number of wishes</li>
<li>The power to dictate the rules governing wishes</li>
<li>an unlimited amount of genies</li>
<li>A universe which is a replica of this one sans rules against meta-wishes</li>
<li>Free transportation to and from that universe</li>
</ul>
