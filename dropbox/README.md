DropBox on old devices (GT-I9500, Android 4.4.2 and 5.0.1) was offering a 50GB of storage for 2 years,  
in-the past I've used to use it, it was great and helped me sync-up files both on my computer and on my phone.  

I no longer need it and as a matter of fact,  
I usually 'freeze' the app and service to them use CPU or being updated.  

I did deodexed my firmware and that resulted with an easy to package and distribute apps,  
and I've also recently updated the bloatware-removing zip from https://github.com/eladkarako/debloat_deknox_by_eladkarako to remove those too.  

But since it has some potential I've archived the two apps you'll need in 7z archive,  
and uploaded it to here: https://github.com/eladkarako/icompile/releases/download/latest/dropbox_and_dropboxoobe_from_i9500_android501__put_under__system_app__deodexed_get_50gb_for_2_years.7z  

If you had or wish to use it,  
you need to be rooted,  
and copy those two folder to under <code>/system/app/</code>,  
you may or may-not remove the cache+dalvik cache and reboot the device.
