You might have hears of the newest (well.. to date) CSS pseudo-class,
the <code>:focus-within</code>.

While you can create style-effect, depending on the focus-state of either of the node's descendant,
(yes, this also includes descendants of the shadow trees :]),
this is essentially a respond to a much needed (but still not fully here... yet...), from child to parent rule-set.

You can use it on latest Chromium, Chrome beta (<a href="https://blog.chromium.org/2017/06/chrome-60-beta-paint-timing-api-css.html" target="_blank">v60+</a>) and pretty much every Mozilla-Firefox from version 50+ (Firefox got there before Chrome? whaaaaat?)
