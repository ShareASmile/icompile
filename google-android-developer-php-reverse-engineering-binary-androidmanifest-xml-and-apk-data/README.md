in addition, I've made few improvements to the original code I've wrote a week ago,
the 'dumping' of the data from the APK, proven to be very useful,
so I've made it easier to use:
running:
<code style="display:inline !important;">$data = getApkFileInfo('{apk path}', true, true);</code>
will dump:
- all images (name will have their width/height)
- best quality image (with name identical to the apk file name, with png suffix).
- the data as json file, 
    now <strong>also including</strong> the page to each of the dumped-image-files on the OS.
