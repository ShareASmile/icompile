For Chrome/Chromium.

When you "talk to the video-renderer", to specify that all compositor resources should be backed by GPU memory buffers,
You use the "feature flag" <code>--enable-gpu-memory-buffer-compositor-resources</code>,
while good for various developing aspects, it will show you green video screen instead of the video (on YouTube).

Please do not use it for now.
